News 1 Title: "ReMoDDeD Beta Update Released! (0.9.9.8)"
News 1 Message: "This is the first major update since my health issues; so I did my best to make it a banger! A new mapping system has been introduced into the mod, which should add some more endgame content and replayability into the mix. Got a few new custom patreon items added and some other random goodies. As always, check out our Discord for more info and full changelogs. Enjoy!"
News 2 Title: "Thanks for your Support!"
News 2 Message: "I would like to take the time to officially say thank you for everyone's continued patience and support during this 'slow time' as I bounce back from my health issues.
