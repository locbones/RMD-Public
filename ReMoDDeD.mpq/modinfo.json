News 1 Message: "This update adds a big new system to the mod, Limit Breaking! The player level cap has been raised to 125, but you will need to limit break and complete additional 'quests' in order to reach this new plateau of power. Expect this system to adapt and evolve over time, but I strongly recommend heading to our Discord or our Youtube for more info on this important change. As always, have fun!"
