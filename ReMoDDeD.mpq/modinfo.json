News 1 Message: "This is another fairly large update that should add a lot of fixes and core improvements to the mod. Such as the addition of a more thematic melee splash system, many skill improvements/changes, new item additions, and our usual round of bug fixes to even things out. Expect Demon Relics to be coming around the corner in the next update or two. I hope you guys have fun with the new upgrades until then, enjoy!"
