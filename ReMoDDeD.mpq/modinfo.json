News 1 Title: "ReMoDDeD Beta Update Released! (0.9.9.9A)"
News 1 Message: "This is another small update for you guys (even though it was large effort for me, heh) that adds the ability to change your in-game UI theme. I know not everyone is the biggest fan of the red, so now you can choose the retail UI or 6 different color varations of our mod's UI. In order to use this feature, version 2.5.5+ of D2RLaunch or version 1.1.5+ of D2RLAN is needed. Please enjoy this aesthetic improvement!"
