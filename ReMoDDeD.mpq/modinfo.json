News 1 Title: "ReMoDDeD Beta Update Released! (0.9.9.8A)"
News 1 Message: "This update includes a lot of fixes for the previous update as well as some mapping adjustments and global item changes. Sprinkle in a few new items, mercenary improvements and skill tweaks and we got ourselves an update. I strongly recommend you create a new character and/or regenerate items to avoid any conflicts from older configurations. Sorry for the hassle, but please enjoy the update and thanks for your patience!"
News 2 Title: "Thanks for your Support!"
News 2 Message: "I would like to take the time to officially say thank you for everyone's continued patience and support during this 'slow time' as I bounce back from my health issues.
