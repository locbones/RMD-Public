News 1 Title: "ReMoDDeD Beta Update Released! (0.9.9.7A)"
News 1 Message: "This update focused primarily on Summon adjustments, UI improvements and the usual round of bug fixes. Your summons (melee especially) are much more responsive/aggressive and should feel more like companions instead of derpy dunces. Starting with this patch, you'll also notice new ways to summon monsters automatically; this mechanic will expand in time. Enjoy the new UI improvement/polish as the mod inches ever closer to our public release candidate!"
News 2 Title: "D2RLaunch 2.0 has arrived!"
News 2 Message: "D2RLaunch has been re-built from the ground up to be more stable, more efficient and have improved functionality. It will look and behave very similarly to the old D2RLaunch; just now with a more dynamic UI and "professional" implementation. Please give special Thanks to @Alias and all his effort in spearheading this re-vamp. More details of the new and improved D2RLaunch can be found on our discord."
