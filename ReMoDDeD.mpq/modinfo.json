News 1 Title: "ReMoDDeD Beta Update Released! (0.9.9.8ZZZ)"
News 1 Message: "This is a smaller update to remove event-drop items from our 3-year celebration and implement a few changes that were carried out during that time. Thanks for being patient as some of the other community tools (and life) grabbed more of our attention this month than normal. Enjoy the new Forsaken Pact Set 'Memento Mori', I wonder who will be the first to discover it?"
News 2 Title: "D2RLaunch 2.5.0!"
News 2 Message: "One of the reasons the content in the mod was lacking this month, was due to the amount of work that went into this version's upgraded systems. Overall, the app should be more reliable, with better data logging, compatibility, and a few small bug fixes. In addition, the app has now been made open-source, with additional documentation and file info. Hope you enjoy it!"
