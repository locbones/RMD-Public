News 1 Title: "ReMoDDeD Beta Update Released! (0.9.9.7C)"
News 1 Message: "This is a compatibility update for Patch 2.7.3 of the D2R Client Files. If you are seeing a version mismatch error on startup, you will need to update either your mod or client files. The Terror Zone schedule has also been updated for users experiencing issues with that. Not much else to say for this one; expect the next update to be more normally sized. "
News 2 Title: "Thanks for your Support!"
News 2 Message: "I would like to take the time to officially say thank you for everyone's continued patience and support during this 'slow time' as I bounce back from my health issues. I feel guilty enough as-is, so I appreciate that it's not coming from you guys also, heh. You guys are rockstars as always, and I hope to continue normal development pacing soon!"
