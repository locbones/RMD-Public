News 1 Title: "ReMoDDeD Beta Update Released! (0.9.9.6B)"
News 1 Message: "Another large update that brings many skill, monster and other gameplay adjustments to the mod. You will find that some monsters have new abilities, increased damage, reduced ai delays and more - expect a difficulty bump. In addition, more time was spent updating tooltips, info panels and fixing some long-standing bugs. I recommend checking out our starter tips in Discord to help you adapt to all the new changes. Thanks as always for your support and patience!"
News 2 Title: "Kills, Deaths and Weight Bonuses/Penalties"
News 2 Message: "You will likely find yourself with 0 Mana on first updating the mod; this is normal. Please grab a fresh kill tracker charm from a new character to fix this issue. Furthermore, you may notice changes to your mana regen, movement speed, +allskills and more.  I strongly recommend checking out our Discord or the in-game mod info menu for more details on these changes. Kills, Deaths and Charm Weight will now provide bonuses or penalties for varying stats."
