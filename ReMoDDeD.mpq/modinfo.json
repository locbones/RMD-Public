News 1 Message: "This is a fairly large content update that also serves to celebrate our 2-year Anniversary of the Alpha release. New Horadric Rift recipes, mechanics and many improvements have been made to help expand build options. The monster buff has officially started, you will notice some enemies now have new skills, faster missiles, etc. As always, a healthy dose of bug fixes were also focused on. I hope you guys enjoy the ever-expanding mod and thanks for your patience and support!"
News 2 Title: "Kills, Deaths and Weight Bonuses/Penalties"
News 2 Message: "You will likely find yourself with 1 HP on first updating the mod; this is normal. Please grab a fresh kill tracker charm from a new character to fix this issue. Furthermore, you may notice changes to your mana regen, movement speed, +allskills and more.  I strongly recommend checking out our Discord or the in-game mod info menu for more details on these changes. Kills, Deaths and Charm Weight will now provide bonuses or penalties for varying stats."
