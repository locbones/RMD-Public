In order to properly use the mod without the launcher, and while on SteamDeck; please follow these instructions:
- Browse to your main D2R Folder, then go into your "Mods" folder. If one doesn't exist; create it.
- Once in your mods folder, create a folder named "ReMoDDeD"
- Drag the "ReMoDDeD.mpq" folder from the .zip you downloaded and place it in your newly created ReMoDDeD folder
- Now browse to D2R/Mods/ReMoDDeD/ReMoDDeD.mpq/Data/global/ui/layouts - Copy the "characterselectpanelhd.json" file from the .zip and replace the original in this folder

While the mod is technically installed now, you will need to know how to run it, and some additional info will help with that
To run the mod you can either use the BNET launcher or a custom shortcut

-To use a custom shortcut, right-click D2R.exe and select the "create shortcut" option. Right-click the shortcut and select properties.
In the "target" textbox, add this (with a space before it) after all of the text in the box: -mod remodded -enablerespec

- To use the BNET launcher, you will enter in the same special command, but in the game settings of the bnet launcher
Choose the "additional command line arguments" box to show the text field


It's now installed and ready to use, but you have 2 more optional tasks you might like to perform:
- Delete the "D2RLaunch" folder found in Remodded.mpq/data folder...you wont be needing it if not using the launcher - Free up some space
- Copy the SharedStashSoftCoreV2.d2i file from the mod .zip download to your saved games folder - Unlock the extra stash tabs
This is usually located in C:/Users/MyUserName/Saved Games/D2R/Mods/ReMoDDeD. It will not exist yet if you've never played the mod.


With these lengthy instructions complete; you can now see why the one-click install available from launcher is the preferred method.
Enjoy the mod!
